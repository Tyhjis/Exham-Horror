the idea and atmosphere of the game are really nice
love the exactum, well made (the maze spinning on the sky is very cool)
good opening art and music but i couldn't really tell if it was trying to tell a story
i didn't really get the shadow's mechanics or how to avoid it so maybe have some kind of info on that to the player
the gun didn't seem to be doing any damage?
the mouse sensitivity was very high for some reason, had to set it lower manually from the mouse
